<h2><a id="top">What makes a superhero?</a></h2>
<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the 
    ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    So in order to be a superhero, <strong>you need a power that is more exceptional 
    than any power a normal human being could possess,</strong> and you need to use that power 
    to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered 
    a superhero.<br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular 
    police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with 
    a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy
    is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then 
    I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
