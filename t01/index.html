            According to Wong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could prove to 
            be the greatest threat out of all the Infinity Stones. Gamora 
            knew of the location of the Soul Stone from a map she found to its
             whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept this a secret from Thanos.

            The Eye of Agamotto is an ancient artifact, a pendant created 
            by Agamotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme, presumably to contain
             and harness the power of the green Time Stone contained inside.
              After being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal
               in Kamar-Taj, it was recently wielded by Doctor Stephen Strange,
                first to aid him in his learning of sorcery, then in his final 
                fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu.

            The Tesseract is named for its cube-like appearance and is capable of controlling space itself, providing the user instant access to any location throughout the universe if used cor
            rectly. The unique element that composes the Tesseract has also been used to create advanced weaponry by races like the Humans. This stone played an important role in humanity's 
            development during the dawn of the superhero age, attracting the attention of f
            orces such as Red Skull and Thanos, both of whom sought to use the Tesseract's power for their own sinister intents.

            The Scepter was a weapon that utilized the yellow Mind Stone housed inside a blue computer module, which also masked the stone's presence. 
            Stark originally saw the Stone as a power source, whereas once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the stone he stated it was more akin to a very powerful computer. 
            The stone within had already been in the possession of Thanos when he gave it to Loki to aid him in his invasion of Earth.

            The Aether appears as a dark, red, viscous liquid. It acts as a symbiotic force, capable of being absorbed into the body of a living host, giving the user the ability to warp reality at will, granting that person immense strength, durability, powers, and subjective influence over the universe. 
            Malekith planned to use the Aether's reality-bending abilities to cover all Nine Realms in darkness; however, he was stopped by the combined efforts of Thor and Jane Foster. 
            Only two people, Jane Foster and Malekith, are known to have been hosts for the Aether, but circumstances prevented the full extent of the Aether's potential from being explored.

            The Power Stone is an incredible power source, it increases the user's physical abilities and allows it to manipulate energy, which, when used at full potential, has enough power 
            to obliterate an entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the Accuser to acquire it from the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for destroying Xandar. However, Star-Lord acquired the stone first and was prepared to sell it to Taneleer Tivan ("The Collector") with 
            Gamora until its destructive power was unleashed at Knowhere.
